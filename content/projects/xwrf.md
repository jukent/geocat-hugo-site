XWRF is a lightweight interface for working with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output in Xarray. The primary objective of xWRF is to replicate crucial functionality from the wrf-python package in a way that is more convenient for users and provides seamless integration with the rest of the Pangeo software stack.
