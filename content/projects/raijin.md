The goal of this three-year NSF Earth Cube funded effort is to
develop open source, Python based tools for the analysis of simulation
data sampled on unstructured grids. Next generation models of the
earth’s climate and global weather will employ unstructured meshes
to enable greater scalability and unprecedented higher resolutions
needed for more realistic and accurate modeling of the earth system.
