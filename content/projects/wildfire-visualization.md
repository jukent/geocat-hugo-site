##### Term: 2021 - 2023
##### Funding source: NSF
##### Partners: NCAR, Northern Arizona University
##### Website: [VAPOR](https://www.vapor.ucar.edu/)

[VAPOR](https://www.vapor.ucar.edu/) has been used for years to help communicate new findings in wildfire simulations from codes like [WRF-Fire](https://ral.ucar.edu/model/wrf-fire-wildland-fire-modeling) and [CAWFE](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/people/coen/files/newpage_c.html), through 3D visualization.  Recently, visualizations of Colorado's East Troublesome Wildfire and Marshall Wildfire have been used to assess the responses to simulation data from people affected by these disasters through [NCAR's Innovators Program](https://edec.ucar.edu/university-partnerships/innovators).  These visualizations have also been used in [explainer videos](https://youtu.be/yXX0UNa2XZU) for research in artificial intelligence at NCAR's Research Applications Laboratory, and have [taken home a Best Overall Visualization award](https://youtu.be/Km5xs-KPfeI) at the PEARC23 conference in Portland, Oregon.
