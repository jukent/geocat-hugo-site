Accessibility of scientific visualizations for people who are blind/vision impaired (PBVI) is a critically underexplored area in visualization research. The overarching goal of this project is to lay the groundwork to incorporate accessibility considerations in the existing visualization workflow, by consolidating accessibility guidelines, identifying accessibility barriers through interviews with students and professionals in geosciences who are blind/vision impaired and establishing a collaboration network with PBVIs for future projects.
