Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT), established in 2019, is the 
project with several software tools developed in Python in order to lead the 
software engineering efforts of the National Center for Atmospheric Research 
(NCAR) Computational and Information Systems Lab (CISL)’s “Pivot to Python” 
initiative.

GeoCAT essentially aims at creating scalable data analysis and visualization 
tools for Earth System Science data to serve the geosciences community in the 
scientific Python ecosystem. 

GeoCAT tools are built upon the cornerstone technologies in the Pangeo stack 
such as Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter Notebooks. Novel research and development 
is conducted for analyzing/visualizing structured as well as unstructured 
grid data from various research fields such as climate, weather, atmosphere, 
ocean, etc. In addition, some of the functionalities in the GeoCAT stack are 
inspired/reimplemented from NCL (NCAR Command Language).

Support for GeoCAT is provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation.
