The [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team has launched "GeoCAT 
Tutorials" to provide its community with guided teaching as well as 
self-taught content.

The tutorial materials can be accessed via [GitHub 
repository](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-tutorials); by cloning and 
setting up a local configuration as described in the repository home, 
or through [Binder 
environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/geocat-tutorials/main) 
right away online! 

The content can be viewed as a statically generated [documentation 
page](https://geocat-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as well. 
Readers of this documentation page can also access past tutorial 
versions.
